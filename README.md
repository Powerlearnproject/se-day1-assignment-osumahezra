Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is a systematic application of Engineering principles in the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It involves the use of structured methods, programming language to create, efficient, reliable and scalable software system.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Early Foundations (1940s-1950s):  This period saw the invention of the first Digital Computers like ENIAC and UNIVAC.Software was written in machine code and assembly language. They had Assembly languages which simplified programming. There was the birth of High-level languages FORTRAN (1957) and LISP (1958) (1950s)
-The Software Crisis & Structured Programming (1960s – 1970s): Growing software complexity led to unreliable and costly projects. Hence, the introduction of the term “Software Engineering” coined at the 1968 NATO Conference to address these challenges. Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming to improve readability and maintainability. Languages like Pascal (1970) and C (1972) emerged.The Waterfall Model (1970) formalized a step-by-step approach to software development.
-Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Software Development Methodologies (1980s – 1990s): Smalltalk (1980) and C++ (1985) introduced OOP concepts which promoted reusability, modularity, and scalability. Spiral Model (1986) combined iterative development with risk assessment and formalised software testing methods were introduced. The World Wide Web (1991) expanded software’s reach, Java (1995) enabled cross-platform development and the open-source movement grew with Linux (1991) and Apache (1995).

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Planning Tthe project scope, objectives, and feasibility is defined. Resources, risks, and cost estimates are identified. Establishing a timeline for development is done. At the end of this stage, we should have a Project plan, feasibility study and risk assessment.
-


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
