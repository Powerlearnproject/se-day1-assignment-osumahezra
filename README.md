#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Q1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.** 

Software Engineering is a systematic application of Engineering principles in the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It involves the use of structured methods, programming language to create, efficient, reliable and scalable software system.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**Early Foundations (1940s-1950s)**:  This period saw the invention of the first Digital Computers like ENIAC and UNIVAC.Software was written in machine code and assembly language. They had Assembly languages which simplified programming. There was the birth of High-level languages FORTRAN (1957) and LISP (1958) (1950s)

**The Software Crisis & Structured Programming (1960s – 1970s)**: Growing software complexity led to unreliable and costly projects. Hence, the introduction of the term “Software Engineering” coined at the 1968 NATO Conference to address these challenges. Edsger Dijkstra promoted structured programming to improve readability and maintainability. Languages like Pascal (1970) and C (1972) emerged.The Waterfall Model (1970) formalized a step-by-step approach to software development.

**Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) & Software Development Methodologies (1980s – 1990s)**: Smalltalk (1980) and C++ (1985) introduced OOP concepts which promoted reusability, modularity, and scalability. Spiral Model (1986) combined iterative development with risk assessment and formalised software testing methods were introduced. The World Wide Web (1991) expanded software’s reach, Java (1995) enabled cross-platform development and the open-source movement grew with Linux (1991) and Apache (1995).


**Q2. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**

**Planning** : The project scope, objectives, and feasibility is defined. Resources, risks, and cost estimates are identified. Establishing a timeline for development is done. At the end of this stage, we should have a Project plan, feasibility study and risk assessment.

**Requirements Analysis**: At this phase, we Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements, conduct discussions with stakeholders (clients, users, business teams), create Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. Key deliverables include SRS document, use cases, process diagrams.

**Design**: At thi phase, we architect the system structure and design components, define database design, user interfaces, and system architecture and choose technology stack and development tools. The key deliverables are System architecture diagrams, UI/UX prototypes, database schema.

**Implementation (Coding & Development)**: This phase, developers write code based on design specifications, following coding standards and best practices using version control systems like Git for collaboration. Some of the key deliverables are Source code, APIs, modules, application builds.

**Testing**: At this phase, we Perform unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). We also identify and fix bugs, ensuring software meets requirements. Testing can be automated when applicable. The key deliverables are test cases, bug reports, test results.

**Deployment**: At this phase, software is released to production or staging environments. It is then deployed using cloud platforms or on-premises servers. System performance is monitored and deployment issues resolved. The key deliverables are deployed application, deployment plan, rollback strategy.

**Maintenance & Support**: This phase involves the Provision of updates, bug fixes, and performance optimizations. Security vulnerabilities are monitored and patches applied. Features are enhanced based on user feedback. The key deliverables are maintenance logs, software updates, performance reports.


**Q3.  Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**

The Waterfall Model and Agile Model are two major software development methodologies. While the Waterfall Model follows a linear, sequential approach, the Agile Model is iterative and flexible.

The differnece in the Waterfall Model and Agile model are highlighted in the following points;

**Approach:** The Waterfall Model follows a sequential, step-by-step process, while the Agile Model is iterative and involves incremental development.

**Flexibility:** The Waterfall Model is rigid, making changes difficult once a phase is completed, whereas the Agile Model is highly flexible and allows changes throughout development.

**Customer Involvement:** In the Waterfall Model, customer involvement is minimal after the initial requirement gathering, while in the Agile Model, customers are continuously involved and provide feedback throughout development.

**Delivery:** The Waterfall Model delivers the full product at the end of the cycle, while the Agile Model delivers working software in small increments.

**Testing:** Testing in the Waterfall Model happens after development is complete, while in the Agile Model, testing is continuous throughout the process.

**Risk Management:** The Waterfall Model has a higher risk since major issues are identified late in the process, whereas the Agile Model has lower risk because problems are detected and resolved early.

**Development Style:** The Waterfall Model follows a linear approach, progressing through predefined steps such as Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance. The Agile Model, on the other hand, is iterative, where software is built and tested in short cycles called sprints.

**Changes & Adaptability:** In the Waterfall Model, it is difficult to accommodate changes once development starts. In contrast, the Agile Model allows easy incorporation of changes based on user feedback.

**Time to Market:** The Waterfall Model has a longer time to market since the entire product is built before release, while the Agile Model enables faster delivery through frequent incremental releases.

**Documentation:** The Waterfall Model requires comprehensive documentation before development begins, whereas the Agile Model focuses less on documentation and more on delivering working software.

**Project Size Suitability:** The Waterfall Model is best suited for small, well-defined projects, while the Agile Model is ideal for complex and evolving projects.

**Testing Approach:** In the Waterfall Model, testing occurs in a single phase after coding is complete. In the Agile Model, continuous testing and integration happen throughout development.

**WHEN TO USE WHICH MODEL?**

The Waterfall Model is best used when: Requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change, The project is small with a fixed budget and timeline, Detailed documentation is required, such as in government and healthcare projects.
The Agile Model is preferable when: Requirements may change frequently, fast delivery and continuous updates are needed, the project is large, complex, and requires ongoing user feedback.
